# PID Control Self Driving Car

We are implementing a PID controller for a self-driving car.

The goal is to control the gas pedal and brake pedal to move the car to the destination parking spot. 

Different motion models are provided in the simulator to mimick various driving environment. Feel free to change the motion model and see how to tune the PID controller accordingly. 

By running the "car_controller_pid.py", you can get the following demonstrations.
